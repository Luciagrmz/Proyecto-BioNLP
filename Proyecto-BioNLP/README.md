#### Proyecto-BioNLP
This Repository contains the necessary information to compare the classificators: SVM (Support Vector Machine) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) within a given dataset that contains a list of abstracts from the biomedicine literature. It contains scripts implemented in python, one-liner perl commands and linux-shell. 

## Getting Started
-Principal Dependencies needed: scikit-learn 0.19.0, fuzzywuzzy 0.15.1 and  re 7.2
- The repository is divided in four parts:
    + Data: divided in data for the training, testing, the validation for the abstracts obtained and other data
    + Codes: scripts to process, train, test and get asociations
    + Reports: model, vectorizer and report for the best classificator
    + Results: Associations obtained from all the approaches, a table with all the f-scores obtained from the 600 combinations and the Test Report

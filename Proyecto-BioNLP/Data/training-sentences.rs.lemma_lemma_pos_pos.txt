result : single nucleotide polymorphism in two gene show some evidence for association to social phobia : in ARNTL2 rs2306073 ( p = .0099 ) and in DRD2 rs7131056 ( p = .0084 ) . NNS : JJ NN NNS IN CD NNS VBD DT NN IN NN TO JJ NN : IN NN RSNUM ( NN JJ CD ) CC IN NN RSNUM ( NN JJ NN ) .
BCL2 rs12454712 ( p = .0029 ) and DRD2 rs4245146 ( p = .0010 ) show evidence for association to generalize anxiety disorder , whereas rs2463107 ( p = .0064 ) in PAWR and rs4245146 ( p = .0029 ) in DRD2 show evidence for association to the pooled group of all anxiety disorder .

in the 1st stage ( 784 case versus 782 control ) we genotype 13 tag snp within 5p15 .33 region to further investigate the association . IN DT JJ NN ( CD NNS CC CD NNS ) PRP VBD CD NN NNS IN NN CD NN TO RB VB DT NN .
after the 2nd stage validation ( 975 case versus 1022 control ) , the study clarify the association that rs2736100 of the TERT gene confer the high significant risk of lung cancer ( p = 4x10 ( -3 ) in the 1st stage association , p = 4x10 ( -4 ) in the 2nd stage validation , and p = 1x10 ( -5 ) , odds ratio = 1.24 in the combined population ) .

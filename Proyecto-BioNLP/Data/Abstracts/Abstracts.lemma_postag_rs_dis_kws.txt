background: polymorphic variation at the 5p15.33 (tert-clptm1l) locus be associate with the risk of many cancer but a relationship withr colorectal cancer (crc) risk have yet to be defined. NN JJ NN IN DT NN NN NN VBZ KEYWD IN DT KEYWD IN JJ NNS CC DT KEYWD NN DIS NN KEYWD VBZ RB TO VB VBN 
methods: we use datum from six genome-wide association study (gwas) of crc, linkage disequilibrium mapping and imputation, to examine the relationship between 73 single-nucleotide polymorphism at 5p15.33 and crc risk in detail.

results: rs2736100, which localise to intron 2 of tert, provide the strongest evidence of a association with crc (p=2.28 x 10(-)(4)). NN NN WDT VBZ TO NN CD IN NN VBD DT JJS KEYWD IN DT KEYWD IN NN CD CC CD

surprising few pathway signal between cell , raise question about mechanism for tissue-specific response .   
in particular , Wnt ligand signal in many mammalian tissue , include the intestinal epithelium , where constitutive signaling cause cancer .   
genome-wide analysis of dna cis-regulatory region bind by the intestine-restricted transcription factor CDX2 in colonic cell uncovered high significant overrepresentation of sequence that bind TCF4 , a transcriptional effector of intestinal Wnt signaling .   
chromatin immunoprecipitation confirm TCF4 occupancy at many such site and co-occupancy of CDX2 and TCF4 across short distance . DIS

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Impaired-glucose-tolerance and impaired insulin secretion have be report in family with PAX6 mutation and it be suggest that they result from defective proinsulin processing due to lack of prohormone convertase 1/3 , encode by PCSK1 . DIS   
we investigate whether a common PAX6 variant will mimic these finding and explore in detail its effect on islet function in man .

introduction : it have be estimate that the proportion of never-smoker among female with lung cancer be 53 % worldwide and 75 % in korea . DIS   
we conduct a two-stage study to identify genetic factor responsible for lung cancer susceptibility in female never-smoker . DIS DIS  KEYWD

to further investigate the molecular mechanism of this variant , we analyse expression of IL-6R in peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( pbmc ) in 128 volunteer from the cambridge BioResource .

the major route of NNK metabolism be carbonyl reduction by AKR1C1 , AKR1C2 , CBR1 , and 11beta-HSD1 to form NNAL .   
this study investigate the potential role of variant in this pathway on lung cancer risk by examine 53 tag-snp represent the common variation in AKR1C1 , AKR1C2 , CBR1 , and HSD11B1 in 456 lung cancer case and 807 control . DIS DIS  KEYWD

the risk of develop papillary thyroid carcinoma ( ptc ) , the much frequent form of thyroid malignancy , be elevated up to 8.6-fold in first-degree relative of ptc patient . DIS DIS  KEYWD KEYWD  
the familial risk can be explain by high-penetrance mutation in yet unidentified gene , or polygenic action of low-penetrance allele .  KEYWD  
since the dna-damaging exposure to ionize radiation be a known risk factor for thyroid cancer , polymorphism in dna repair gene be likely to affect this risk . DIS  KEYWD KEYWD   
in a search for low-penetrance susceptibility allele we employ Sequenom technology to genotype deleterious polymorphism in atm , CHEK2 , and brca1 in 1,781 ptc patient and 2,081 healthy control .  KEYWD

this be confirm clinical by the finding of reduce brca1 gene expression in triple negative sample from patient carry the homozygous tt variant , compare to non-variant patient . DIS  NEGKEYWD  
the BRCA1-3 ` utr-variant ( Tg or tt ) also associate with a modest increase risk for develop breast cancer in the west-irish cohort ( or = 1.4 , 95 % ci 1.1-1 .8 , p = 0.033 ) . DIS  KEYWD KEYWD

support that this finding be due to tumor biology , and not difficulty screen , obese woman with the BRCA1-3 ` utr-variant have significant little dense breast ( p = 0.0398 ) in the vermont cohort .  NEGKEYWD  
conclusion : a variant in the 3 ` UTR of brca1 be functional , lead to decrease brca1 expression , modest increase breast cancer risk , and much important , presentation with stage IV breast cancer , likely due to aggressive tumor biology . DIS DIS  KEYWD

alcohol dependence ( ad ) be a moderate heritable phenotype with a small number of known risk gene map via linkage or candidate gene study .  KEYWD KEYWD  
we consider 313 male from among 595 member of document , extend pedigree in which ad segregate collect in northern Hunan province , china .   
a joint analysis of both male and female can not be perform as the difference in alcohol consumption variance be too large . DIS  NEGKEYWD  
genome-wide association analysis be perform for approximate 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) .  KEYWD

abnormality in the enzymatic activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase ( comt ) contribute to chronic pain condition , such as temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . DIS DIS   
thus , we seek to determine the effect of polymorphism in comt and functional related pain gene in the comt pathway ( estrogen receptor 1 [ ESR1 ] , guanosine-5-triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 [ GCH1 ] , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [ MTHFR ] ) on comt enzymatic activity , musculoskeletal pain , and pain-related intermediate phenotype among TMD case and healthy control subject . DIS  KEYWD

among individual with the comt meet allele , those with 2 copy of the GCH1 rs10483639 minor g allele exhibit normalize comt activity and increase mechanical pain threshold . RSNUM   
among individual with the comt Val allele , those with 2 copy of the ESR1 rs3020377 minor a allele exhibit reduce comt activity , increase bodily pain , and poor self-reported health . RSNUM   
these datum reveal that the GCH1 minor g allele confer a protective advantage among meet carrier , whereas the ESR1 minor a allele be disadvantageous among val carrier .   
furthermore , these datum suggest that the ability to predict the downstream effect of genetic variation on comt activity be critical important to understand the molecular basis of chronic pain condition .   
complex human disease do not have a clear inheritance pattern , and it be expect that risk involve multiple gene with modest effect act independent or interact .  NEGKEYWD KEYWD  
major challenge for the identification of genetic effect be genetic heterogeneity and difficulty in analyse high-order interaction .   
to address these challenge , we present mdr-phenomic , a novel approach base on the multifactor dimensionality reduction ( MDR ) method , to detect genetic effect in pedigree datum by integration of phenotypic covariate ( pc ) that may reflect genetic heterogeneity .   
the p value of the test be calculate use a permutation test adjust for multiple test .   
to validate mdr-phenomic , we compare it with two mdr-based method : ( 1 ) traditional MDR pedigree disequilibrium test ( pdt ) without consideration of pc ( MDR-PDT ) and ( 2 ) stratified phenotype ( sp ) analysis base on pc , with use of MDR-PDT with a Bonferroni adjustment ( SP-MDR ) .   
use computer simulation , we examine the statistical power and type i error of the different approach under several genetic model and sampling scenario .   
we conclude that mdr-phenomic be much powerful than MDR-PDT and SP-MDR when there be genetic heterogeneity , and the statistical power be affect by sample size and the number of pc level .  KEYWD  
we further compare mdr-phenomic with conditional logistic regression ( CLR ) for testing interaction across single or multiple locus with consideration of pc .   
the result show that CLR with pc have only slight small power than do mdr-phenomic for single-locus analysis but have considerable small power for multiple locus .   
final , by apply mdr-phenomic to autism , a complex disease in which multiple gene be believe to confer risk , we attempt to identify multiple gene effect in two candidate gene of interest -- the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) and the integrin beta 3 gene ( ITGB3 ) on chromosome 17 .

in cell carry D2R snp , miR-217 mimic also decrease the expression of TGFbeta1 and its target .   
Wnt5a , a miR-217 target , be increase in cell carry D2R snp and decrease by miR-217 mimic but increase by miR-217 inhibitor in both cell type .   
in cell carry D2R wild-type , Wnt5a treatment increase TGFbeta1 while silencing Ror2 , a Wnt5a receptor , decrease TGFbeta1 and blunt the wnt5a-induced increase in cell carry D2R wild-type .   
our result show that renal proximal tubule cell from subject carry D2R snp result in D2R downregulation have increase TGFbeta1 that be mediate by decrease regulation of the miR-217-Wnt5a-Ror2 pathway .

due to alternative splicing in human , SNP-D10N encode two mutate ACT1 protein , ACT1-D10N and ACT1-D19N .   
although both ACT1 isoform be Hsp90 client protein , the nine additional amino acid in ACT1-D19N provide a additional Hsp90 binding site that be absent in ACT1-D10N .
